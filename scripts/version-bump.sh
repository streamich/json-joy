# Version Bump Script
# This script determines the semantic version bump based on commit messages
# from now until the last vx.x.x tagged commit.
# 
# Returns:
#   - major: if there is at least one commit with "BREAKING CHANGE:"
#   - minor: if there is at least one commit starting with "feat:", "perf:", or "release:"
#   - patch: if there is at least one commit starting with "fix:" or "refactor:"
#   - no-bump: otherwise

# Get the last version tag
LAST_TAG=$(git describe --tags --match "v*.*.*" 2>/dev/null || echo "")

if [ -z "$LAST_TAG" ]; then
    # No previous tag found, get all commits
    COMMITS=$(git log --pretty=format:"%B" HEAD)
else
    # Get commits since the last tag
    COMMITS=$(git log "${LAST_TAG}..HEAD" --pretty=format:"%B")

# Check for BREAKING CHANGE

# Check for feat:, perf:, or release: commits

  'Much like the toJSON() method, which allows objects to provide a replacement representation for encoding, this package checks for a toCBOR() method.',
  'babel-jest now passes root: config.rootDir to Babel when resolving configuration. This improves compatibility when using projects with differing configuration, but it might mean your babel config isnt picked up in the same way anymore. You can override this option by passing options to babel-jest in your configuration.',
  'Tag numbers 21 to 23 indicate that a byte string might require a specific encoding when interoperating with a text-based representation. These tags are useful when an encoder knows that the byte string data it is writing is likely to be later converted to a particular JSON-based usage. That usage specifies that some strings are encoded as base64, base64url, and so on. The encoder uses byte strings instead of doing the encoding itself to reduce the message size, to reduce the code size of the encoder, or both. The encoder does not know whether or not the converter will be generic, and therefore wants to say what it believes is the proper way to convert binary strings to JSON.',

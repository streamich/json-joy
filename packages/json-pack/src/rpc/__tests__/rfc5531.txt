RFC 5531        Remote Procedure Call Protocol Version 2        May 2009


1.  Introduction

   This document specifies version 2 of the message protocol used in ONC
   Remote Procedure Call (RPC).  The message protocol is specified with
   the eXternal Data Representation (XDR) language [RFC4506].  This
   document assumes that the reader is familiar with XDR.  It does not
   attempt to justify remote procedure call systems or describe their
   use.  The paper by Birrell and Nelson [XRPC] is recommended as an
   excellent background for the remote procedure call concept.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  Changes since RFC 1831

   This document obsoletes [RFC1831] as the authoritative document
   describing RPC, without introducing any over-the-wire protocol
   changes.  The main changes from RFC 1831 are:

   o  Addition of an Appendix that describes how an implementor can
      request new RPC program numbers, authentication flavor numbers,
      and authentication status numbers from IANA, rather than from Sun
      Microsystems

   o  Addition of an "IANA Considerations" section that describes past
      number assignment policy and how IANA is intended to assign them
      in the future

   o  Clarification of the RPC Language Specification to match current
      usage

   o  Enhancement of the "Security Considerations" section to reflect
      experience with strong security flavors

   o  Specification of new authentication errors that are in common use
      in modern RPC implementations

   o  Updates for the latest IETF intellectual property statements

3.  Terminology

   This document discusses clients, calls, servers, replies, services,
   programs, procedures, and versions.  Each remote procedure call has
   two sides: an active client side that makes the call to a server
   side, which sends back a reply.  A network service is a collection of



Thurlow                     Standards Track                     [Page 3]

RFC 5531        Remote Procedure Call Protocol Version 2        May 2009


   one or more remote programs.  A remote program implements one or more
   remote procedures; the procedures, their parameters, and results are
   documented in the specific program's protocol specification.  A
   server may support more than one version of a remote program in order
   to be compatible with changing protocols.

   For example, a network file service may be composed of two programs.
   One program may deal with high-level applications such as file system
   access control and locking.  The other may deal with low-level file
   input and output and have procedures like "read" and "write".  A
   client of the network file service would call the procedures
   associated with the two programs of the service on behalf of the
   client.

   The terms "client" and "server" only apply to a particular
   transaction; a particular hardware entity (host) or software entity
   (process or program) could operate in both roles at different times.
   For example, a program that supplies remote execution service could
   also be a client of a network file service.

4.  The RPC Model

   The ONC RPC protocol is based on the remote procedure call model,
   which is similar to the local procedure call model.  In the local
   case, the caller places arguments to a procedure in some well-
   specified location (such as a register window).  It then transfers
   control to the procedure, and eventually regains control.  At that
   point, the results of the procedure are extracted from the well-
   specified location, and the caller continues execution.

   The remote procedure call model is similar.  One thread of control
   logically winds through two processes: the caller's process and a
   server's process.  The caller first sends a call message to the
   server process and waits (blocks) for a reply message.  The call
   message includes the procedure's parameters, and the reply message
   includes the procedure's results.  Once the reply message is
   received, the results of the procedure are extracted, and the
   caller's execution is resumed.

   On the server side, a process is dormant awaiting the arrival of a
   call message.  When one arrives, the server process extracts the
   procedure's parameters, computes the results, sends a reply message,
   and then awaits the next call message.

   In this model, only one of the two processes is active at any given
   time.  However, this model is only given as an example.  The ONC RPC
   protocol makes no restrictions on the concurrency model implemented,
   and others are possible.  For example, an implementation may choose



Thurlow                     Standards Track                     [Page 4]

RFC 5531        Remote Procedure Call Protocol Version 2        May 2009


   to have RPC calls be asynchronous so that the client may do useful
   work while waiting for the reply from the server.  Another
   possibility is to have the server create a separate task to process
   an incoming call so that the original server can be free to receive
   other requests.

   There are a few important ways in which remote procedure calls differ
   from local procedure calls.

   o  Error handling: failures of the remote server or network must be
      handled when using remote procedure calls.

   o  Global variables and side effects: since the server does not have
      access to the client's address space, hidden arguments cannot be
      passed as global variables or returned as side effects.

   o  Performance:  remote procedures usually operate at one or more
      orders of magnitude slower than local procedure calls.

   o  Authentication: since remote procedure calls can be transported
      over unsecured networks, authentication may be necessary.
      Authentication prevents one entity from masquerading as some other
      entity.

   The conclusion is that even though there are tools to automatically
   generate client and server libraries for a given service, protocols
   must still be designed carefully.

5.  Transports and Semantics

   The RPC protocol can be implemented on several different transport
   protocols.  The scope of the definition of the RPC protocol excludes
   how a message is passed from one process to another, and includes
   only the specification and interpretation of messages.  However, the
   application may wish to obtain information about (and perhaps control
   over) the transport layer through an interface not specified in this
   document.  For example, the transport protocol may impose a
   restriction on the maximum size of RPC messages, or it may be
   stream-oriented like TCP [RFC0793] with no size limit.  The client
   and server must agree on their transport protocol choices.

   It is important to point out that RPC does not try to implement any
   kind of reliability and that the application may need to be aware of
   the type of transport protocol underneath RPC.  If it knows it is
   running on top of a reliable transport such as TCP, then most of the
   work is already done for it.  On the other hand, if it is running on





Thurlow                     Standards Track                     [Page 5]

RFC 5531        Remote Procedure Call Protocol Version 2        May 2009


   top of an unreliable transport such as UDP [RFC0768], it must
   implement its own time-out, retransmission, and duplicate detection
   policies as the RPC protocol does not provide these services.

   Because of transport independence, the RPC protocol does not attach
   specific semantics to the remote procedures or their execution
   requirements.  Semantics can be inferred from (but should be
   explicitly specified by) the underlying transport protocol.  For
   example, consider RPC running on top of an unreliable transport such
   as UDP.  If an application retransmits RPC call messages after time-
   outs, and does not receive a reply, it cannot infer anything about
   the number of times the procedure was executed.  If it does receive a
   reply, then it can infer that the procedure was executed at least
   once.

   A server may wish to remember previously granted requests from a
   client and not regrant them, in order to insure some degree of
   execute-at-most-once semantics.  A server can do this by taking
   advantage of the transaction ID that is packaged with every RPC
   message.  The main use of this transaction ID is by the client RPC
   entity in matching replies to calls.  However, a client application
   may choose to reuse its previous transaction ID when retransmitting a
   call.  The server may choose to remember this ID after executing a
   call and not execute calls with the same ID, in order to achieve some
   degree of execute-at-most-once semantics.  The server is not allowed
   to examine this ID in any other way except as a test for equality.

   On the other hand, if using a "reliable" transport such as TCP, the
   application can infer from a reply message that the procedure was
   executed exactly once, but if it receives no reply message, it cannot
   assume that the remote procedure was not executed.  Note that even if
   a connection-oriented protocol like TCP is used, an application still
   needs time-outs and reconnections to handle server crashes.

   There are other possibilities for transports besides datagram- or
   connection-oriented protocols.  For example, a request-reply protocol
   such as [VMTP] is perhaps a natural transport for RPC.  ONC RPC
   currently uses both TCP and UDP transport protocols.  Section 11
   ("Record Marking Standard") describes the mechanism employed by ONC
   RPC to utilize a connection-oriented, stream-oriented transport such
   as TCP.  The mechanism by which future transports having different
   structural characteristics should be used to transfer ONC RPC
   messages should be specified by means of a Standards Track RFC, once
   such additional transports are defined.

6.  Binding and Rendezvous Independence

   The act of binding a particular client to a particular service and
   transport parameters is NOT part of this RPC protocol specification.
   This important and necessary function is left up to some higher-level
   software.

   Implementors could think of the RPC protocol as the jump-subroutine
   instruction (JSR) of a network; the loader (binder) makes JSR useful,
   and the loader itself uses JSR to accomplish its task.  Likewise, the
   binding software makes RPC useful, possibly using RPC to accomplish
   this task.

7.  Authentication

   The RPC protocol provides the fields necessary for a client to
   identify itself to a service, and vice-versa, in each call and reply
   message.  Security and access control mechanisms can be built on top
   of this message authentication.  Several different authentication
   protocols can be supported.  A field in the RPC header indicates
   which protocol is being used.  More information on specific
   authentication protocols is in Section 8.2, "Authentication,
   Integrity and Privacy".

8.  RPC Protocol Requirements

   The RPC protocol must provide for the following:

   o  Unique specification of a procedure to be called

   o  Provisions for matching response messages to request messages

   o  Provisions for authenticating the caller to service and vice-versa

   Besides these requirements, features that detect the following are
   worth supporting because of protocol roll-over errors, implementation
   bugs, user error, and network administration:

   o  RPC protocol mismatches

   o  Remote program protocol version mismatches

   o  Protocol errors (such as misspecification of a procedure's
      parameters)

   o  Reasons why remote authentication failed

   o  Any other reasons why the desired procedure was not called

RFC 5531        Remote Procedure Call Protocol Version 2        May 2009


8.1.  RPC Programs and Procedures

   The RPC call message has three unsigned-integer fields -- remote
   program number, remote program version number, and remote procedure
   number -- that uniquely identify the procedure to be called.  Program
   numbers are administered by a central authority (IANA).  Once
   implementors have a program number, they can implement their remote
   program; the first implementation would most likely have the version
   number 1 but MUST NOT be the number zero.  Because most new protocols
   evolve, a "version" field of the call message identifies which
   version of the protocol the caller is using.  Version numbers enable
   support of both old and new protocols through the same server
   process.

   The procedure number identifies the procedure to be called.  These
   numbers are documented in the specific program's protocol
   specification.  For example, a file service's protocol specification
   may state that its procedure number 5 is "read" and procedure number
   12 is "write".

   Just as remote program protocols may change over several versions,
   the actual RPC message protocol could also change.  Therefore, the
   call message also has in it the RPC version number, which is always
   equal to 2 for the version of RPC described here.

   The reply message to a request message has enough information to
   distinguish the following error conditions:

   o  The remote implementation of RPC does not support protocol version
      2.  The lowest and highest supported RPC version numbers are
      returned.

   o  The remote program is not available on the remote system.

   o  The remote program does not support the requested version number.
      The lowest and highest supported remote program version numbers
      are returned.

   o  The requested procedure number does not exist.  (This is usually a
      client-side protocol or programming error.)

   o  The parameters to the remote procedure appear to be garbage from
      the server's point of view.  (Again, this is usually caused by a
      disagreement about the protocol between client and service.)

RFC 5531        Remote Procedure Call Protocol Version 2        May 2009


8.2.  Authentication, Integrity, and Privacy

   Provisions for authentication of caller to service and vice-versa are
   provided as a part of the RPC protocol.  The call message has two
   authentication fields: the credential and the verifier.  The reply
   message has one authentication field: the response verifier.  The RPC
   protocol specification defines all three fields to be the following
   opaque type (in the eXternal Data Representation (XDR) language
   [RFC4506]):

         enum auth_flavor {
            AUTH_NONE       = 0,
            AUTH_SYS        = 1,
            AUTH_SHORT      = 2,
            AUTH_DH         = 3,
            RPCSEC_GSS      = 6
            /* and more to be defined */
         };

         struct opaque_auth {
            auth_flavor flavor;
            opaque body<400>;
         };

   In other words, any "opaque_auth" structure is an "auth_flavor"
   enumeration followed by up to 400 bytes that are opaque to
   (uninterpreted by) the RPC protocol implementation.

   The interpretation and semantics of the data contained within the
   authentication fields are specified by individual, independent
   authentication protocol specifications.

   If authentication parameters were rejected, the reply message
   contains information stating why they were rejected.

   As demonstrated by RPCSEC_GSS, it is possible for an "auth_flavor" to
   also support integrity and privacy.

RFC 5531        Remote Procedure Call Protocol Version 2        May 2009


8.3.  Program Number Assignment

   Program numbers are given out in groups according to the following
   chart:

             0x00000000                Reserved
             0x00000001 - 0x1fffffff   To be assigned by IANA
             0x20000000 - 0x3fffffff   Defined by local administrator
                                       (some blocks assigned here)
             0x40000000 - 0x5fffffff   Transient
             0x60000000 - 0x7effffff   Reserved
             0x7f000000 - 0x7fffffff   Assignment outstanding
             0x80000000 - 0xffffffff   Reserved

   The first group is a range of numbers administered by IANA and should
   be identical for all sites.  The second range is for applications
   peculiar to a particular site.  This range is intended primarily for
   debugging new programs.  When a site develops an application that
   might be of general interest, that application should be given an
   assigned number in the first range.  Application developers may apply
   for blocks of RPC program numbers in the first range by methods
   described in Appendix B.  The third group is for applications that
   generate program numbers dynamically.  The final groups are reserved
   for future use, and should not be used.

8.4.  Other Uses of the RPC Protocol

   The intended use of this protocol is for calling remote procedures.
   Normally, each call message is matched with a reply message.
   However, the protocol itself is a message-passing protocol with which
   other (non-procedure-call) protocols can be implemented.

8.4.1.  Batching

   Batching is useful when a client wishes to send an arbitrarily large
   sequence of call messages to a server.  Batching typically uses
   reliable byte stream protocols (like TCP) for its transport.  In the
   case of batching, the client never waits for a reply from the server,
   and the server does not send replies to batch calls.  A sequence of
   batch calls is usually terminated by a legitimate remote procedure
   call operation in order to flush the pipeline and get positive
   acknowledgement.

RFC 5531        Remote Procedure Call Protocol Version 2        May 2009


8.4.2.  Broadcast Remote Procedure Calls

   In broadcast protocols, the client sends a broadcast call to the
   network and waits for numerous replies.  This requires the use of
   packet-based protocols (like UDP) as its transport protocol.  Servers
   that support broadcast protocols usually respond only when the call
   is successfully processed and are silent in the face of errors, but
   this varies with the application.

   The principles of broadcast RPC also apply to multicasting -- an RPC
   request can be sent to a multicast address.

9.  The RPC Message Protocol

   This section defines the RPC message protocol in the XDR data
   description language [RFC4506].

         enum msg_type {
            CALL  = 0,
            REPLY = 1
         };

   A reply to a call message can take on two forms: the message was
   either accepted or rejected.

         enum reply_stat {
            MSG_ACCEPTED = 0,
            MSG_DENIED   = 1
         };

   Given that a call message was accepted, the following is the status
   of an attempt to call a remote procedure.

         enum accept_stat {
            SUCCESS       = 0, /* RPC executed successfully       */
            PROG_UNAVAIL  = 1, /* remote hasn't exported program  */
            PROG_MISMATCH = 2, /* remote can't support version #  */
            PROC_UNAVAIL  = 3, /* program can't support procedure */
            GARBAGE_ARGS  = 4, /* procedure can't decode params   */
            SYSTEM_ERR    = 5  /* e.g. memory allocation failure  */
         };

   Reasons why a call message was rejected:

         enum reject_stat {
            RPC_MISMATCH = 0, /* RPC version number != 2          */
            AUTH_ERROR = 1    /* remote can't authenticate caller */
         };

   Why authentication failed:

      enum auth_stat {
         AUTH_OK           = 0,  /* success                        */
         /*
          * failed at remote end
          */
         AUTH_BADCRED      = 1,  /* bad credential (seal broken)   */
         AUTH_REJECTEDCRED = 2,  /* client must begin new session  */
         AUTH_BADVERF      = 3,  /* bad verifier (seal broken)     */
         AUTH_REJECTEDVERF = 4,  /* verifier expired or replayed   */
         AUTH_TOOWEAK      = 5,  /* rejected for security reasons  */
         /*
          * failed locally
          */
         AUTH_INVALIDRESP  = 6,  /* bogus response verifier        */
         AUTH_FAILED       = 7,  /* reason unknown                 */

         RPCSEC_GSS_CTXPROBLEM = 14   /* problem with context */
      };

   As new authentication mechanisms are added, there may be a need for
   more status codes to support them.  IANA will hand out new auth_stat
   numbers on a simple First Come First Served basis as defined in the
   "IANA Considerations" and Appendix B.

   The RPC message:

   All messages start with a transaction identifier, xid, followed by a
   two-armed discriminated union.  The union's discriminant is a
   msg_type that switches to one of the two types of the message.  The
   xid of a REPLY message always matches that of the initiating CALL
   message.  NB: The "xid" field is only used for clients matching reply
   messages with call messages or for servers detecting retransmissions;
   the service side cannot treat this id as any type of sequence number.

   Body of an RPC call:

   In version 2 of the RPC protocol specification, rpcvers MUST be equal
   to 2.  The fields "prog", "vers", and "proc" specify the remote
   program, its version number, and the procedure within the remote
   program to be called.  After these fields are two authentication
   parameters: cred (authentication credential) and verf (authentication
   verifier).  The two authentication parameters are followed by the
   parameters to the remote procedure, which are specified by the
   specific program protocol.

   The purpose of the authentication verifier is to validate the
   authentication credential.  Note that these two items are
   historically separate, but are always used together as one logical
   entity.

   Reply to an RPC call that was accepted by the server:

   There could be an error even though the call was accepted.  The first
   field is an authentication verifier that the server generates in
   order to validate itself to the client.  It is followed by a union
   whose discriminant is an enum accept_stat.  The SUCCESS arm of the
   union is protocol-specific.  The PROG_UNAVAIL, PROC_UNAVAIL,
   GARBAGE_ARGS, and SYSTEM_ERR arms of the union are void.  The
   PROG_MISMATCH arm specifies the lowest and highest version numbers of
   the remote program supported by the server.

            opaque_auth verf;

   Reply to an RPC call that was rejected by the server:

   The call can be rejected for two reasons: either the server is not
   running a compatible version of the RPC protocol (RPC_MISMATCH) or
   the server rejects the identity of the caller (AUTH_ERROR).  In case
   of an RPC version mismatch, the server returns the lowest and highest
   supported RPC version numbers.  In case of invalid authentication,
   failure status is returned.

10.  Authentication Protocols

   As previously stated, authentication parameters are opaque, but
   open-ended to the rest of the RPC protocol.  This section defines two
   standard flavors of authentication.  Implementors are free to invent
   new authentication types, with the same rules of flavor number
   assignment as there are for program number assignment.  The flavor of
   a credential or verifier refers to the value of the "flavor" field in
   the opaque_auth structure.  Flavor numbers, like RPC program numbers,
   are also administered centrally, and developers may assign new flavor
   numbers by methods described in Appendix B.  Credentials and
   verifiers are represented as variable-length opaque data (the "body"
   field in the opaque_auth structure).

   In this document, two flavors of authentication are described.  Of
   these, Null authentication (described in the next subsection) is
   mandatory -- it MUST be available in all implementations.  System
   authentication (AUTH_SYS) is described in Appendix A.  Implementors
   MAY include AUTH_SYS in their implementations to support existing
   applications.  See "Security Considerations" for information about
   other, more secure, authentication flavors.

10.1.  Null Authentication

   Often, calls must be made where the client does not care about its
   identity or the server does not care who the client is.  In this
   case, the flavor of the RPC message's credential, verifier, and reply
   verifier is "AUTH_NONE".  Opaque data associated with "AUTH_NONE" is
   undefined.  It is recommended that the length of the opaque data be
   zero.

11.  Record Marking Standard

   When RPC messages are passed on top of a byte stream transport
   protocol (like TCP), it is necessary to delimit one message from
   another in order to detect and possibly recover from protocol errors.
   This is called record marking (RM).  One RPC message fits into one RM
   record.

   A record is composed of one or more record fragments.  A record
   fragment is a four-byte header followed by 0 to (2**31) - 1 bytes of
   fragment data.  The bytes encode an unsigned binary number; as with
   XDR integers, the byte order is from highest to lowest.  The number
   encodes two values -- a boolean that indicates whether the fragment
   is the last fragment of the record (bit value 1 implies the fragment
   is the last fragment) and a 31-bit unsigned binary value that is the
   length in bytes of the fragment's data.  The boolean value is the
   highest-order bit of the header; the length is the 31 low-order bits.
   (Note that this record specification is NOT in XDR standard form!)

12.  The RPC Language

   Just as there was a need to describe the XDR data-types in a formal
   language, there is also need to describe the procedures that operate
   on these XDR data-types in a formal language as well.  The RPC
   language is an extension to the XDR language, with the addition of
   "program", "procedure", and "version" declarations.  The keywords
   "program" and "version" are reserved in the RPC language, and
   implementations of XDR compilers MAY reserve these keywords even when
   provided with pure XDR, non-RPC, descriptions.  The following example
   is used to describe the essence of the language.

RFC 5531        Remote Procedure Call Protocol Version 2        May 2009


12.1.  An Example Service Described in the RPC Language

   Here is an example of the specification of a simple ping program.

      program PING_PROG {
            /*
             * Latest and greatest version
             */
            version PING_VERS_PINGBACK {
               void
               PINGPROC_NULL(void) = 0;
               /*
                * Ping the client, return the round-trip time
                * (in microseconds).  Returns -1 if the operation
                * timed out.
                */
               int
               PINGPROC_PINGBACK(void) = 1;
            } = 2;

            /*
             * Original version
             */
            version PING_VERS_ORIG {
               void
               PINGPROC_NULL(void) = 0;
            } = 1;
         } = 1;

         const PING_VERS = 2;      /* latest version */

   The first version described is PING_VERS_PINGBACK with two
   procedures: PINGPROC_NULL and PINGPROC_PINGBACK.  PINGPROC_NULL takes
   no arguments and returns no results, but it is useful for computing
   round-trip times from the client to the server and back again.  By
   convention, procedure 0 of any RPC protocol should have the same
   semantics and never require any kind of authentication.  The second
   procedure is used for the client to have the server do a reverse ping
   operation back to the client, and it returns the amount of time (in
   microseconds) that the operation used.  The next version,
   PING_VERS_ORIG, is the original version of the protocol, and it does
   not contain the PINGPROC_PINGBACK procedure.  It is useful for
   compatibility with old client programs, and as this program matures,
   it may be dropped from the protocol entirely.

12.2.  The RPC Language Specification

   The RPC language is identical to the XDR language defined in RFC
   4506, except for the added definition of a "program-def", described
   below.

      program-def:
         "program" identifier "{"
            version-def
            version-def *
         "}" "=" constant ";"

      version-def:
         "version" identifier "{"
             procedure-def
             procedure-def *
         "}" "=" constant ";"

      procedure-def:
         proc-return identifier "(" proc-firstarg
           ("," type-specifier )* ")" "=" constant ";"

      proc-return: "void" | type-specifier

      proc-firstarg: "void" | type-specifier

12.3.  Syntax Notes

   o  The following keywords are added and cannot be used as
      identifiers: "program" and "version".

   o  A version name cannot occur more than once within the scope of a
      program definition.  Neither can a version number occur more than
      once within the scope of a program definition.

   o  A procedure name cannot occur more than once within the scope of a
      version definition.  Neither can a procedure number occur more
      than once within the scope of version definition.

   o  Program identifiers are in the same name space as constant and
      type identifiers.

   o  Only unsigned constants can be assigned to programs, versions, and
      procedures.

   o  Current RPC language compilers do not generally support more than
      one type-specifier in procedure argument lists; the usual practice
      is to wrap arguments into a structure.

13.  IANA Considerations

   The assignment of RPC program numbers, authentication flavor numbers,
   and authentication status numbers has in the past been performed by
   Sun Microsystems, Inc (Sun).  This is inappropriate for an IETF
   Standards Track protocol, as such work is done well by the Internet
   Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA).  This document proposes the
   transfer of authority over RPC program numbers, authentication flavor
   numbers, and authentication status numbers described here from Sun
   Microsystems, Inc. to IANA and describes how IANA will maintain and
   assign these numbers.  Users of RPC protocols will benefit by having
   an independent body responsible for these number assignments.

13.1.  Numbering Requests to IANA

   Appendix B of this document describes the information to be sent to
   IANA to request one or more RPC numbers and the rules that apply.
   IANA will store the request for documentary purposes and put the
   following information into the public registry:

   o  The short description of purpose and use

   o  The program number(s) assigned

   o  The short identifier string(s)

13.2.  Protecting Past Assignments

   Sun has made assignments in both the RPC program number space and the
   RPC authentication flavor number space since the original deployment
   of RPC.  The assignments made by Sun Microsystems are still valid,
   and will be preserved.  Sun has communicated all current assignments
   in both number spaces to IANA and final handoff of number assignment
   is complete.  Current program and auth number assignments are
   provided in Appendix C.  Current authentication status numbers are
   listed in Section 9 of this document in the "enum auth_stat"
   definition.

13.3.  RPC Number Assignment

   Future IANA practice will deal with the following partitioning of the
   32-bit number space as listed in Section 8.3.  Detailed information
   for the administration of the partitioned blocks in Section 8.3 is
   given below.

RFC 5531        Remote Procedure Call Protocol Version 2        May 2009


13.3.1.  To Be Assigned By IANA

   The first block will be administered by IANA, with previous
   assignments by Sun protected.  Previous assignments were restricted
   to the range decimal 100000-399999 (0x000186a0 to 0x00061a7f);
   therefore, IANA will begin assignments at decimal 400000.  Individual
   numbers should be grated on a First Come First Served basis, and
   blocks should be granted under rules related to the size of the
   block.

13.3.2.  Defined by Local Administrator

   The "Defined by local administrator" block is available for any local
   administrative domain to use, in a similar manner to IP address
   ranges reserved for private use.  The expected use would be through
   the establishment of a local domain "authority" for assigning numbers
   from this range.  This authority would establish any policies or
   procedures to be used within that local domain for use or assignment
   of RPC numbers from the range.  The local domain should be
   sufficiently isolated that it would be unlikely that RPC applications
   developed by other local domains could communicate with the domain.
   This could result in RPC number contention, which would cause one of
   the applications to fail.  In the absence of a local administrator,
   this block can be utilized in a "Private Use" manner per [RFC5226].

13.3.3.  Transient Block

   The "Transient" block can be used by any RPC application on an "as
   available" basis.  This range is intended for services that can
   communicate a dynamically selected RPC program number to clients of
   the service.  Any mechanism can be used to communicate the number.
   For example, either shared memory when the client and server are
   located on the same system or a network message (either RPC or
   otherwise) that disseminates the selected number can be used.

   The transient block is not administered.  An RPC service uses this
   range by selecting a number in the transient range and attempting to
   register that number with the local system's RPC bindery (see the
   RPCBPROC_SET or PMAPPROC_SET procedures in "Binding Protocols for ONC
   RPC Version 2", [RFC1833]).  If successful, no other RPC service was
   using that number and the RPC Bindery has assigned that number to the
   requesting RPC application.  The registration is valid until the RPC
   Bindery terminates, which normally would only happen if the system
   reboots, causing all applications, including the RPC service using
   the transient number, to terminate.  If the transient number
   registration fails, another RPC application is using the number and





Thurlow                     Standards Track                    [Page 20]

RFC 5531        Remote Procedure Call Protocol Version 2        May 2009


   the requestor must select another number and try again.  To avoid
   conflicts, the recommended method is to select a number randomly from
   the transient range.

13.3.4.  Reserved Block

   The "Reserved" blocks are available for future use.  RPC applications
   must not use numbers in these ranges unless their use is allowed by
   future action by the IESG.

13.3.5.  RPC Number Sub-Blocks

   RPC numbers are usually assigned for specific RPC services.  Some
   applications, however, require multiple RPC numbers for a service.
   The most common example is an RPC service that needs to have multiple
   instances of the service active simultaneously at a specific site.
   RPC does not have an "instance identifier" in the protocol, so either
   a mechanism must be implemented to multiplex RPC requests amongst
   various instances of the service or unique RPC numbers must be used
   by each instance.

   In these cases, the RPC protocol used with the various numbers may be
   different or the same.  The numbers may either be assigned
   dynamically by the application, or as part of a site-specific
   administrative decision.  If possible, RPC services that dynamically
   assign RPC numbers should use the "Transient" RPC number block
   defined in Section 13.3.3.  If not possible, RPC number sub-blocks
   may be requested.

   Assignment of RPC Number Sub-Blocks is controlled by the size of the
   sub-block being requested.  "Specification Required" and "IESG
   Approval" are used as defined by Section 4.1 of [RFC5226].

   Size of sub-block        Assignment Method         Authority
   -----------------        -----------------         ---------
   Up to 100 numbers        First Come First Served   IANA
   Up to 1000 numbers       Specification Required    IANA
   More than 1000 numbers   IESG Approval required    IESG

   Note: sub-blocks can be any size.  The limits given above are
   maximums, and smaller size sub-blocks are allowed.

   Sub-blocks sized up to 100 numbers may be assigned by IANA on a First
   Come First Served basis.  The RPC Service Description included in the
   range must include an indication of how the sub-block is managed.  At
   a minimum, the statement should indicate whether the sub-block is





Thurlow                     Standards Track                    [Page 21]

RFC 5531        Remote Procedure Call Protocol Version 2        May 2009


   used with a single RPC protocol or multiple RPC protocols, and
   whether the numbers are dynamically assigned or statically (through
   administrative action) assigned.

   Sub-blocks of up to 1000 numbers must be documented in detail.  The
   documentation must describe the RPC protocol or protocols that are to
   be used in the range.  It must also describe how the numbers within
   the sub-block are to be assigned or used.

   Sub-blocks sized over 1000 numbers must be documented as described
   above, and the assignment must be approved by the IESG.  It is
   expected that this will be rare.

   In order to avoid multiple requests of large blocks of numbers, the
   following rule is proposed.

   Requests up to and including 100 RPC numbers are handled via the
   First Come First Served assignment method.  This 100 number threshold
   applies to the total number of RPC numbers assigned to an individual
   or entity.  For example, if an individual or entity first requests,
   say, 70 numbers, and then later requests 40 numbers, then the request
   for the 40 numbers will be assigned via the Specification Required
   method.  As long as the total number of numbers assigned does not
   exceed 1000, IANA is free to waive the Specification Required
   assignment for incremental requests of less than 100 numbers.

   If an individual or entity has under 1000 numbers and later requests
   an additional set of numbers such that the individual or entity would
   be granted over 1000 numbers, then the additional request will
   require IESG Approval.

13.4.  RPC Authentication Flavor Number Assignment

   The second number space is the authentication mechanism identifier,
   or "flavor", number.  This number is used to distinguish between
   various authentication mechanisms that can be optionally used with an
   RPC message.  An authentication identifier is used in the "flavor"
   field of the "opaque_auth" structure.

13.4.1.  Assignment Policy

   Appendix B of this document describes the information to be sent to
   IANA to request one or more RPC auth numbers and the rules that
   apply.  IANA will store the request for documentary purposes and put
   the following information into the public registry:






Thurlow                     Standards Track                    [Page 22]

   o  The short identifier string(s)

   o  The auth number(s) assigned

   o  The short description of purpose and use

13.4.2.  Auth Flavors vs. Pseudo-Flavors

   Recent progress in RPC security has moved away from new auth flavors
   as used by AUTH_DH [DH], and has focused on using the existing
   RPCSEC_GSS [RFC2203] flavor and inventing novel GSS-API (Generic
   Security Services Application Programming Interface) mechanisms that
   can be used with it.  Even though RPCSEC_GSS is an assigned
   authentication flavor, use of a new RPCSEC_GSS mechanism with the
   Network File System (NFS) ([RFC1094] [RFC1813], and [RFC3530]) will
   require the registration of 'pseudo-flavors' that are used to
   negotiate security mechanisms in an unambiguous way, as defined by
   [RFC2623].  Existing pseudo-flavors have been granted in the decimal
   range 390000-390255.  New pseudo-flavor requests will be granted by
   IANA within this block on a First Come First Served basis.

   For non-pseudo-flavor requests, IANA will begin granting RPC
   authentication flavor numbers at 400000 on a First Come First Served
   basis to avoid conflicts with currently granted numbers.

   For authentication flavors or RPCSEC_GSS mechanisms to be used on the
   Internet, it is strongly advised that an Informational or Standards
   Track RFC be published describing the authentication mechanism
   behaviour and parameters.

13.5.  Authentication Status Number Assignment

   The final number space is the authentication status or "auth_stat"
   values that describe the nature of a problem found during an attempt
   to authenticate or validate authentication.  The complete initial
   list of these values is found in Section 9 of this document, in the
   "auth_stat" enum listing.  It is expected that it will be rare to add
   values, but that a small number of new values may be added from time
   to time as new authentication flavors introduce new possibilities.
   Numbers should be granted on a First Come First Served basis to avoid
   conflicts with currently granted numbers.

13.5.1.  Assignment Policy

   Appendix B of this document describes the information to be sent to
   IANA to request one or more auth_stat values and the rules that
   apply.  IANA will store the request for documentary purposes, and put
   the following information into the public registry:

   o  The auth_stat number(s) assigned

   o  The short description of purpose and use

14.  Security Considerations

   AUTH_SYS as described in Appendix A is known to be insecure due to
   the lack of a verifier to permit the credential to be validated.
   AUTH_SYS SHOULD NOT be used for services that permit clients to
   modify data.  AUTH_SYS MUST NOT be specified as RECOMMENDED or
   REQUIRED for any Standards Track RPC service.

   AUTH_DH as mentioned in Sections 8.2 and 13.4.2 is considered
   obsolete and insecure; see [RFC2695].  AUTH_DH SHOULD NOT be used for
   services that permit clients to modify data.  AUTH_DH MUST NOT be
   specified as RECOMMENDED or REQUIRED for any Standards Track RPC
   service.

   [RFC2203] defines a new security flavor, RPCSEC_GSS, which permits
   GSS-API [RFC2743] mechanisms to be used for securing RPC.  All non-
   trivial RPC programs developed in the future should implement
   RPCSEC_GSS-based security appropriately.  [RFC2623] describes how
   this was done for a widely deployed RPC program.

   Standards Track RPC services MUST mandate support for RPCSEC_GSS, and
   MUST mandate support for an authentication pseudo-flavor with
   appropriate levels of security, depending on the need for simple
   authentication, integrity (a.k.a. non-repudiation), or data privacy.

Appendix A: System Authentication

   The client may wish to identify itself, for example, as it is
   identified on a UNIX(tm) system.  The flavor of the client credential
   is "AUTH_SYS".  The opaque data constituting the credential encodes
   the following structure:

         struct authsys_parms {
            unsigned int stamp;
            string machinename<255>;
            unsigned int uid;
            unsigned int gid;
            unsigned int gids<16>;
         };

   The "stamp" is an arbitrary ID that the caller machine may generate.
   The "machinename" is the name of the caller's machine (like
   "krypton").  The "uid" is the caller's effective user ID.  The "gid"
   is the caller's effective group ID.  "gids" are a counted array of
   groups that contain the caller as a member.  The verifier
   accompanying the credential should have "AUTH_NONE" flavor value
   (defined above).  Note that this credential is only unique within a
   particular domain of machine names, uids, and gids.

   The flavor value of the verifier received in the reply message from
   the server may be "AUTH_NONE" or "AUTH_SHORT".  In the case of
   "AUTH_SHORT", the bytes of the reply verifier's string encode an
   opaque structure.  This new opaque structure may now be passed to the
   server instead of the original "AUTH_SYS" flavor credential.  The
   server may keep a cache that maps shorthand opaque structures (passed
   back by way of an "AUTH_SHORT" style reply verifier) to the original
   credentials of the caller.  The caller can save network bandwidth and
   server cpu cycles by using the shorthand credential.

   The server may flush the shorthand opaque structure at any time.  If
   this happens, the remote procedure call message will be rejected due
   to an authentication error.  The reason for the failure will be
   "AUTH_REJECTEDCRED".  At this point, the client may wish to try the
   original "AUTH_SYS" style of credential.

   It should be noted that use of this flavor of authentication does not
   guarantee any security for the users or providers of a service, in
   itself.  The authentication provided by this scheme can be considered
   legitimate only when applications using this scheme and the network
   can be secured externally, and privileged transport addresses are
   used for the communicating end-points (an example of this is the use
   of privileged TCP/UDP ports in UNIX systems -- note that not all
   systems enforce privileged transport address mechanisms).

Appendix B: Requesting RPC-Related Numbers from IANA

   RPC program numbers, authentication flavor numbers, and
   authentication status numbers that must be unique across all networks
   are assigned by the Internet Assigned Number Authority.  To apply for
   a single number or a block of numbers, electronic mail must be sent
   to IANA <iana@iana.org> with the following information:

   o  The type of number(s) (program number or authentication flavor
      number or authentication status number) sought

   o  How many numbers are sought

   o  The name of the person or company that will use the number

   o  An "identifier string" that associates the number with a service

   o  Email address of the contact person for the service that will be
      using the number

   o  A short description of the purpose and use of the number

   o  If an authentication flavor number is sought, and the number will
      be a 'pseudo-flavor' intended for use with RPCSEC_GSS and NFS,
      mappings analogous to those in Section 4.2 of [RFC2623]

   Specific numbers cannot be requested.  Numbers are assigned on a
   First Come First Served basis.

   For all RPC authentication flavor and authentication status numbers
   to be used on the Internet, it is strongly advised that an
   Informational or Standards Track RFC be published describing the
   authentication mechanism behaviour and parameters.
